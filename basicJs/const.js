//just like let, const can only be declared once
// with const you can't re assign to that var just like let will allow
// use const when you don't want variable to change
//const is usually capital letters e.g FCC, OLDCATS

const animal = "cat"
animal = "dog";
console.log(dog);

//above code will throw an error
